# UCM Programming Projects

A showcase of university-level programming mini-projects from Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Each project demonstrates fundamental problemâ€‘solving approaches, language-specific features, and common architectural practices.


## ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview

### 1. SimulaciÃ³n de Carreras de Coches (C++)

A textâ€‘based car racing simulator that reads track and surprise definitions from input files. Cars move concurrently on the track, random events affect their progress, and results are recorded. This project highlights modular code organization, use of basic data structures, and simple randomization techniques to model unpredictable behavior.

### 2. Solitario (C++)

A console-based Solitaire game implementation driven by external level configurations. The game logic, board representation, move validation, and rendering are separated into distinct modules. Emphasis is on managing dynamic game state, fileâ€‘based input/output, and a clear division between core mechanics and display logic.

### 3. The Lemmings Game (Java) (done equally with [@MarcoRamirezMedina](https://github.com/MarcoRamirezMedina))

An objectâ€‘oriented adaptation of the classic Lemmings puzzle. Characters exhibit different behaviors (walking, digging, blocking) in response to game events. The code uses a central event loop to process user actions and environment triggers, with behavior encapsulated in interchangeable components, illustrating clean separation of concerns and extendable design.

### 4. Traffic Simulator (Java) (done equally with [@MarcoRamirezMedina](https://github.com/MarcoRamirezMedina))

A discreteâ€‘event simulation of vehicles moving through configurable road networks. Traffic lights and vehicles react to a shared simulation clock, and events (vehicle arrivals, signal changes) drive the progression. The project demonstrates simulation techniques, modular network construction, and decoupled component interaction.
